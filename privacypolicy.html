            <h2>Privacy Policy:</h2>
            <h3>Updated: December 1, 2023</h3>
            <h1>aiHCS Website Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This is aiHCS’s Website Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”). To aiHCS (“we” or “us” or “our”), your privacy
                is of the utmost importance. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard
                your personal information when you visit our website. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you
                do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access this website.</p>
            <h2>Personal Information We Collect and How We Use and Share It</h2>
            <p>Presently, aiHCS does not publicly offer any products or services, through its website or otherwise, so
                the personal information we collect from you is limited. The personal information we collect includes:
            </p>
            <h3>Information You Provide.</h3>
            <p>This information may include personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address. This
                information may be collected when you choose to interact with our website as well as with third-party
                websites that are linked with our website. If you do not want us to have such information, please do not
                provide it.</p>
            <p>We will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.</p>
            <p>At all times, aiHCS reserves the right to disclose your personal information where required by law or to
                comply with a valid legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order), to investigate or
                remedy potential violations of our policies, to protect Zoox’s rights or property, or during emergencies
                when personal safety is at risk.</p>
            <p>We may also share your personal information with our third-party service providers (but only as necessary
                to provide services to us) and our affiliates, in which case we will require those third-party service
                providers and affiliates to keep such information confidential and use it only for the purposes for
                which we disclose it to them.</p>
            <p>Finally, we may share your personal information with a buyer or other successor company in the event of a
                merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganisation, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all
                of aiHCS’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar
                proceeding, in which personal information held by aiHCS about our website visitors is among the assets
                transferred.</p>
            <h2>Your Choices</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information, or would like to opt
                out of any future contacts from us, please contact us at support@aiHCS.ai. In addition, to the extent
                required by applicable law, you may have the right to request access to or delete your personal
                information. If you wish to do any of these things, please contact us at the email address listed above.
            </p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss
                and from unauthorised access, use, alteration and disclosure. But no security measures are 100% secure
                and, thus, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. Any transmission of personal
                information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention by any third party of any
                privacy settings or security measures we implement.</p>
            <h2>Updates</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time and for any reason. You
                should check this Privacy Policy regularly to see if there have been any changes. We will alert you
                about any changes by updating the “Updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You will be deemed to have been
                made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted changes in any revised Privacy
                Policy by your continued use of the website after the date the revised Privacy Policy is posted.</p>
